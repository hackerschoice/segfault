# Or start all your daemons quickly like this:
# Example:
# nohup sleep 31337 &>/dev/null &
#
# Bash supervisor hack (restart on exit every 10 seconds):
# supervise() {
#    (exec -a "[supervise] $1: bash" bash -c 'while :; do "$@"; sleep 10; done &>/dev/null' -- "$@" &>/dev/null </dev/null &)
# }
# supervise my-daemon 31337
# Restart: killall my-daemon
# Stop   : killall -g my-daemon
#
# Or start them the System-V way:
# service nginx start
# service postgresql start
# service pagekite start
