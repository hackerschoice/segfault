# This is a hack.
# - Docker sets the default route to IP of the host-side of the bridge
# - Our 'sf-router' container likes to receive all the traffic instead.
# - Remove host's bridge ip address (flush) 
# - sf-router's init.sh script will take over the IP of host's bridge (and thus receiving all traffic)
# An alternative would be to assign a default gw in user's sf-shell
# and use nsenter -n to change the default route (without giving NET_ADMIN
# to the user).
